  INSTALLATION AND USAGE INSTRUCTION
 ==================================================

  DAMICORE is an easy-to-use clustering and classification tool.

  DAMICORE is a pipeline of algorithms which is agnostic to the type of data
  thanks to NCD, a compressor-based metric which views any piece of data as
  simply a string of bits. This is particularly well-suited for heterogenous
  datasets, datasets with difficult characteristics extraction and text datasets.

DEPENDENCIES
------------------------------

For installation, the following software tools are needed

* python 2.7
* igraph library (visit http://igraph.org/c for more informations)
* python-igraph (visit http://igraph.org/python for more informations)
* (Optional) munkres:
     $ sudo apt install pip
     $ pip install munkres

For execution, DamicorePy relies on compressor programs to calculate the 
distance between a  pair of objects (files). Make sure the following tools
are installed

* zlib (should be available in every Python installation)
* gzip (available in almost all \*nix systems)
* bz2 (common compression library, available via `sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev` in Debian/Ubuntu)
* bzip2 (available in almost all \*nix systems)
* ppmd (available via packages, or at http://ctxmodel.net/files/PPMd, or may
         be `make`-ed at the ppmdi2 local directory)
* paq8 (available at http://mattmahoney.net/dc/paq8l.zip, or may be `make`-ed
         at the paq8 local directory)

It is also recommended

* FigTree (available in http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)

INSTALLING
------------------------------

With the source code, you can install the module at the top level with:
     
     $ sudo python setup.py install

And then you can import the module with python like so: 

     $ python -m damicore.damicore --help

HELP

To get command-line help, use

    $ damicore.py --help

USAGE

The simplest way to use DAMICORE is to provide as argument a directory
containing all files to be compared:

     $ damicore.py example/texts

Command-line options may also be placed in a file, with one argument per line:

     $ damicore.py +args_file.txt

OUTPUTTING

Without other options, the program outputs a list of pairs of file name and
corresponding cluster index. You can output intermediate steps into different
files for analysis:

     $ damicore.py example/texts --results-dir results

This will output all intermediate results to the folder `results/texts`. The
results are numbered, so previous results won't be overwritten. The results
include:

* <num>-args.txt       - arguments used in execution, which can be used as detailed
                           in the "Usage" section.
* <num>-ncd.csv        - information of NCD run in CSV format
* <num>-ncd.phylip     - NCD distance matrix in Phylip format
* <num>-tree.newick    - phylogenetic tree in Newick format
* <num>-tree.svg       - tree image, with colors representing clusters found
* <num>-membership.csv - clustering output, with pairs (instance, cluster index)
* <num>-partition.csv  - if a reference clustering was provided, output several 
                           partition comparison indices.

You can choose just some intermediate steps to be outputted, and their format
when available:

    $ damicore.py example/texts --ncd-output matrix.dat --matrix-format csv
    $ damicore.py example/texts --tree-output tree.newick
    $ damicore.py example/texts --graph-image tree.png
    $ damicore.py example/texts --output my-membership.csv
    $ damicore.py example/texts --compare-to example/texts_clusters.csv \
    > --partition-output partition.csv

NCD OPTIONS

By default, the script uses PPMd as compressor. If you don't have it installed,
try using zlib, gzip or bzip2:

     $ damicore.py example/texts --compressor gzip

gzip and bzip2 both have a 'level' option, varying from 1 to 9. Higher level
means best compression in exchange of speed. The default is 6.

     $ damicore.py example/texts --compressor bzip2 --level 9

It is possible to control the model order and memory of PPMd, in MiB. The higher
the order, the more complex patterns can be found, and more memory is used. The
default values are 6 and 10, respectively.

     $ damicore.py example/texts --compressor ppmd --model-order 12 --memory 100

One other feature, still in test, is interleaving blocks of both files to
generate the paired file to be compressed. This might be useful for files larger
than the window size for gzip and bzip2 (32 KiB and 900 KiB, respectively). It
is recommended that the block size be smaller than half the window size.

     $ damicore.py example/texts --compressor gzip --pairing interleave \
     > --block-size 8192
     $ damicore.py example/texts --compressor bzip2 --pairing interleave \
     > --block-size 450000

TREE GENERATION

For now, the only available algorithm for tree generation is Neighbor Joining.
You can specify that the input NCD matrix be normalized prior to the
simplification, which seems to improve clustering when the distances are clustered
around a mean.

     $ damicore.py example/texts --normalize-matrix

CLUSTERING

There are several algorithms to detect communities in networks. Some of them are
available using the --community-detection option:

* Fast Newman (--fast): Greedy algorithm that optimizes modularity in a
 bottom-up fashion, at each step joining communities that most increment
 modularity.
* Edge Betweenness, or Girvan-Newman (--betweenness): Greedy algorithm that
 works in a top-down fashion, at each step removing the edge with maximum
 betweenness.
* Walktrap (--walktrap): Finds communities by performing small random walks in
 the tree
* Optimal Modularity (--optimal): Optimizes modularity globally. It is
 recommended for small trees only, with less than 100 nodes.

Except for the optimal algorithm, the other methods outputs dendograms that may
be cut to provide a given number of clusters. By default they are cut where
modularity is maximized.

    $ damicore.py examples/texts --community-detection betweenness \
    > --num-clusters 5

It is recommended to normalize edge weights if there are negative values or if
they are clustered around a mean. This can be done with --normalize-weights.

CLUSTERING COMPARISON

If you have a standard reference to compare the obtained clustering, you may
provide it and a comparison index will be calculated to assess their
similarity. By default, it computes both Wallace indices.

    $ damicore.py example/texts --compare-to examples/texts_clusters.csv

You can choose one of several indices available by using the --partition-index
option. Most indices range between 0 and 1, where 1 means equality between
partitions. Indices adjusted for chance take the value 0 if partitions are
random, and 1 if they are equal; they can also assume negative values for
"anti-partitions". Mutual information and Variation of Information return
the number of bits of information shared between two partitions.

* 'rand': Rand index
* 'adjusted-rand': Rand index adjusted for chance
* 'wallace', 'left-wallace', 'right-wallace': Wallace indices
* 'adjusted-wallace', 'adjusted-left-wallace', 'adjusted-right-wallace':
   Adjusted Wallace indices
* 'jaccard': Jaccard index
* 'fowlkes-mallows', 'fm': Fowlkes-Mallows index
* 'adjusted-fowlkes-mallows', 'afm': Adjusted Fowlkes-Mallows index
* 'mutual-information', 'mi': Mutual information
* 'variation-of-information', 'vi': Variation of information
* 'incongruence', 'normalized-incongruence': Number of incongruences, or
  normalized between 0 and 1.
* 'classification': Classification index

You can also provide 'all' to compute all indices.

GENERAL

By default, the NCD computation is done in parallel. It is useful for debugging
an error to be able to compute in serial, which can be done with the --serial
option.

TROUBLESHOOTING FAQ
------------------------------

*It starts compressing all files, sits there and then outputs a stacktrace
with `Queue.Empty`*

Do you have the compressor installed? By default DAMICORE uses PPMd; you
can switch the compressor with the --compressor option to gzip or bzip2.

However, if the error persists, try executing with --serial and mail me the
stacktrace. Unfortunetely when running in parallel, any error is swallowed :(

*I get an error sometimes saying "weights must be positive, Invalid value"*

Sometimes, the generated intermediary tree will have negative edge lengths,
and this translates into negative weights for the community detection
algorithm. You can try normalizing them with --normalize-weights, which
will ensure they are all positive.
