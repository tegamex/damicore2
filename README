 DAMICORE-PY - A PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION OF DAMICORE.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 DamicorePy was developed by Cesar B. K. M. [1] as part of his MsC Thesis at
 ICMC, University of São Paulo, under supervision of Dr. Monaco F. J. and
 of the original DAMICORE creator, Dr. Delbem A. C. B., both of of the 
 Deparment of Computer Systems of ICMC-USP.

 DAMICORE, first introduced by Sanches et al. [2], is an unsupervised 
 machine learning method combining techniques from information theory, 
 phylogenetics and Complex Network.  Original DAMICORE implementation was
 written in C. DAMICORE-Py is an alternative implementation written in
 Python.  It include all the functionality of DAMICORE plus some additional
 facilities.  Please, refer to the project documentation and to the cited
 bibliography for further information.
